            <h1>A Brief Introduction to this App</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This web application allows the user to search for information on music artists or groups after registering a user name and password and becoming a member. </h5>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">This application is built on several different languages. PHP is is used for server side purposes including connecting and querying
            a MYSQL database, form validation and api integration. HTML and CSS are used for content display and design purposes. AJAX is used to update a user search without
            reloading the page along with a jQuery plugin to make the images being displayed fill their containers and be centered. This app uses the Last FM API to generate information
            requests by the user, and a Google API to show music videos of artists form Youtube. Data is then parsed using JSON.</p>

            <p class="w3-xlarge">You must become a member to continue further.</p>
