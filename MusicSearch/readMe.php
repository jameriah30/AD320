Music Search is and web application where a user can login and search for information and music videos on their favorite music artists.
This project demonstrates my skills and knowledge of several aspects of web application development including: 
CRUD operations with database using MySQL, Apache and PHP, RESTFUL API calls using cURL,, and the use of AJAX and Javascript to update 
the web page asynchronously by exchanging data with the web server on the backend. This was a well-rounded project that provided a great 
experience in terms of enhancing my skills and furthering my understanding of web application development.
